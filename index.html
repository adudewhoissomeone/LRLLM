    <h1>Hello, welcome to the LLLM website!</h1>
    <h2>A way to test your thinking abilities...with books!</h2>
    <p>I think literature is the ultimate humanity. I mean, think about it; literature may contain aspects of philosophy, history, social science, and more, if you know where and how to look. That's what this organization aims to promote...through some friendly competition. What's the harm in a little friendly competition, no?</p>
